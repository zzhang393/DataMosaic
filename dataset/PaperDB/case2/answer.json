We model this as an online learning problem with delayed feedback, where the length of the delay is unbounded, which we study mainly in a stochastic setting. We show that in this setting, consistency is not possible in general, and that optimal forecasters might not have average regret going to zero. However, it is still possible to give algorithms that converge asymptotically to Bayesoptimal predictions, by evaluating forecasters on specific sparse independent subsequences of their predictions. We give an algorithm that does this, which converges asymptotically on good behavior, and give very weak bounds on how long it takes to converge. We then relate our results back to the problem of predicting large computations in a deterministic setting.",

Supervised learning was performed on labeled data of over 6 million customers using deep convolutional neural networks, which achieved an AUC of 0.743 on the test dataset using no more than 12 temporal features for each customer. Unsupervised learning was conducted using autoencoders to better understand the reasons for customer churn. Images that maximally activate the hidden units of an autoencoder trained with churned customers reveal ample opportunities for action to be taken to prevent churn among strong data, no voice users.",

            "abstract": "Data compression combined with effective encryption is a common requirement of data storage and transmission. Low cost of these operations is often a high priority in order to increase transmission speed and reduce power usage. This requirement is crucial for battery-powered devices with limited resources, such as autonomous remote sensors or implants. Well-known and popular encryption techniques are frequently too expensive. This problem is on the increase as machineto-machine communication and the Internet of Things are becoming a reality. Therefore, there is growing demand for finding trade-offs between security, cost and performance in lightweight cryptography. This article discusses Asymmetric Numeral Systems - an innovative approach to entropy coding which can be used for compression with encryption. It provides compression ratio comparable with arithmetic coding at similar speed as Huffman coding, hence, this coding is starting to replace them in new compressors. Additionally, by perturbing its coding tables, the Asymmetric Numeral System makes it possible to simultaneously encrypt the encoded message at nearly no additional cost. The article introduces this approach and analyzes its security level. The basic application is reducing the number of rounds of some cipher used on ANS-compressed data, or completely removing additional encryption layer if reaching a satisfactory protection level.",
