## 4. Internal Memo: Logistics & Infrastructure Review

**From:** J. Doe, Senior VP
**To:** Investment Committee
**Subject:** Site Visits - Logistics Cluster

I just returned from the site visits. Here are my notes on the three firms we discussed:

1. **SilverLine Logistics Group**: The automated warehouse in Ohio is fully operational. I was impressed by the efficiency. Let's increase our position in **SilverLine** (Code: **003004**).
2. **SwiftStream Logistics**: They are struggling with last-mile delivery costs. I recommend holding our position for now. Legal name is *SwiftStream Logistics*, trading simply as **SwiftStream** (**003013**).
3. **IronClad Construction Co.**: Their backlog of government contracts provides a safety net for the next 24 months. The stock (**IronClad**) is currently undervalued at code **003010**.

## 5. Emerging Opportunities: Aerospace & Automotive

In the advanced manufacturing space, two companies have captured our attention this quarter.

**Stellar Aerospace Technologies** (Display: **Stellar Aero**)
The company recently secured a defense contract valued at $500M. While the stock (**003008**) was halted briefly for the announcement, trading has resumed. We believe *Stellar Aerospace Technologies* is poised for a breakout year.

**Velocity Automotive Labs** (Display: **Velocity Auto**)
Focusing on solid-state battery tech, this small-cap player is high risk, high reward. The code **003016** has seen high volatility. Management at *Velocity Automotive Labs* assures us that the prototype will be ready by Q4.
