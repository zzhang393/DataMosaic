#### 2. Discontinued Operations and Asset Divestitures (Section I)

**Strategic Adjustment Overview:**
Given recent regulatory pressures in the defense sector and the objective to optimize the core balance sheet, the market has closely monitored the movements of **Alpha Dynamics Holdings, Inc.** Following multiple rounds of board deliberations, we officially confirm the following changes:

* **Divestiture of Delta Defense Systems Corp.:**
Although **Alpha Dynamics Holdings, Inc.** has historically served as the holding parent company for **Delta Defense Systems Corp.**, pursuant to a final agreement effective September 30th, Alpha Dynamics has completely sold all its shares in Delta Defense. This move marks the formal decoupling of the two entities.
* **Retained Downstream Interests (The Delta System):**
Despite the change in ownership, the internal architecture of **Delta Defense Systems Corp.** remains stable. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, **Lambda Laser Labs**, continues to operate as its core R&D unit. Notably, **Lambda Laser Labs** retains 100% controlling interest in **Mu Materials Science**. Consequently, although Alpha Dynamics has exited, Delta Defense continues to indirectly control Mu Materials through Lambda Laser.

**Terminated Transactions:**
Regarding the hostile takeover rumors circulating in the market, we hereby clarify: **Omega Ultimate Ventures** did indeed initiate due diligence regarding **Eta Engineering Works**. However, due to irreconcilable differences in valuation models, negotiations officially collapsed on September 20th. **Omega Ultimate Ventures does not hold any shares in Eta Engineering Works.**

#### 3. Strategic Restructuring and Ownership Transfers (Section II)

This quarter witnessed complex equity swaps within the Chemical and Logistics sectors aimed at resolving liquidity crises.

* **Asset Liquidation by Psi Psychological Services:**
**Psi Psychological Services** remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of **Omega Ultimate Ventures** (Omega maintains absolute control). However, to raise operating capital, Psi management decided to divest its non-core industrial assets.
* **Change of Control for Chi Chemical Holdings:**
Following intense bidding, **Psi Psychological Services** transferred its entire equity stake in **Chi Chemical Holdings** to **Rho Rapid Transport**. Upon completion of the transaction, **Rho Rapid Transport** became the sole controlling shareholder of Chi Chemical.
* **Attribution of Phi Precision Tools:**
This transaction included all assets under the Chi Chemical umbrella. Therefore, **Chi Chemical Holdings** continues to hold a controlling stake in **Phi Precision Tools**. This also implies that through this acquisition, **Rho Rapid Transport** has effectively gained indirect control over Phi Precision Tools.

#### 4. Active Holdings and Capital Expansion (Section III)

**Alpha Dynamics’ Logistics and Tech Deployment:**
Despite divesting its defense business, **Alpha Dynamics Holdings, Inc.** remains aggressive in its logistics layout.

1. **Beta Bridge Logistics LLC**: Alpha Dynamics continues to hold a 60% stake in this company, maintaining a controlling position.
2. **Gamma Green Energy Solutions**: This company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of **Beta Bridge Logistics LLC**, focusing on green energy logistics.
3. **Theta Cloud Computing**: This represents a unique hybrid holding case. **Gamma Green Energy Solutions** holds a majority stake in Theta Cloud. However, to accelerate digital transformation, **Alpha Dynamics Holdings, Inc.** has also circumvented intermediate management layers to inject capital directly into **Theta Cloud Computing**, holding direct shares. This constitutes a dual control chain (Direct holding vs. Indirect holding via Beta/Gamma).

#### 5. Financial Group Portfolio Updates (Section IV)

* **Pharmaceutical Sector:** **Epsilon Financial Group** continues to serve as the primary investor in **Zeta Pharmaceuticals Inc.**, with a stable partnership.
* **Global Strategy Sector:** **Epsilon Financial Group** wholly owns **Xi Global Strategies**.
* **Vertical Integration of Energy and Communications:**
**Xi Global Strategies** completed the acquisition of **Omicron Offshore Drilling** this quarter, aiming to position itself in deep-sea energy. Immediately following this, to establish maritime communication links, **Omicron Offshore Drilling** directly acquired **Nu-Wave Communications**.
